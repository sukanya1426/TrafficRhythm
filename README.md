# 🚦 TrafficRhythm: Smart Traffic Signal Optimization Using AI for Bangladesh 2.0

TrafficRhythm is an AI-powered prototype that simulates smart traffic light control to optimize traffic flow in urban areas of Bangladesh. This system dynamically adjusts signal timings based on real or simulated traffic data using machine learning and reinforcement learning.

## 🌍 Problem Statement

Bangladesh faces chronic traffic congestion due to outdated, fixed-time signal systems and heavy reliance on manual traffic control. The inefficiency was especially evident during events like the temporary absence of traffic police on August 5, 2024. 

TrafficRhythm addresses this by offering a scalable, automated solution that reduces congestion and enhances commuter experience.

## 🧠 Core Idea

Build a **machine learning-based simulation model** that:
- Analyzes traffic patterns.
- Predicts future congestion.
- Dynamically adjusts traffic signal durations.
- Improves traffic flow and reduces average wait times.

## 🛠 Features

- 📊 Supervised Learning to predict congestion levels using traffic patterns.
- 🤖 Reinforcement Learning to optimize signal durations through feedback loops.
- 🛣 Simulated intersections with adjustable traffic flow data.
- 📉 Visualizations of before-and-after traffic performance.
- 💡 Scalable design — trainable for multiple intersections and cities.

## 🔧 Tools & Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **Scikit-learn** — for ML models
- **NumPy & Pandas** — data preprocessing
- **Matplotlib** — visualizations

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Use simulated or open-source traffic data (e.g., Kaggle datasets).
   - Features include time of day, vehicle count, signal cycles, etc.

2. **Training**
   - Apply supervised ML (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest).
   - Use reinforcement learning for adaptive control policies.

3. **Simulation**
   - Adjust signal timings dynamically.
   - Measure reduced congestion and improved flow.

4. **Evaluation**
   - Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), average wait time per lane.
